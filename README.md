# Start the service
```sh
# From the proxy service directory root
npm install
npm start
```

## Endpoints
- http://localhost:8001
- http://localhost:8002 (Nice realtime UI)

# Environment configuration
Default configuration values can be found in [src/config.js](src/config.js). To update the default values, create a `.env` file in the root of the API service source code and adjust values accordingly. For the most part this service just provides limited access to certain SAEON endpoints that should not change regardless of the deployment.
